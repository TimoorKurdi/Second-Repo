	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p>Rookie programmer, I enjoy working out, watching sports and spontaneous trips. Moved to NYC a little over ten years ago and since been enjoying the perks of this fair city. I used to be a Banker at TD Bank and have experience working in The Financial Services Industry. Apart from taking an intro course in college in Computer Science, my first real experience that got me introduced to web development was while I was at the Bank. I would spend my time using various databases for different transactions when I came to the conclusion that I was more attracted to the process that helped bring about these transactions rather than the transactions themselves. I've always had an innate curiosity as to how things work and love the feeling of building something from scratch. I left the Bank and after taking a few online tutorials over the last few months I decided I'm ready to take the next step in my career in becoming a full time dev. </p>

	<h3>Interesting facts</h3>
	<p>I'm tri-ethnic! and although I grew up in India, I <b><i>also</i></b> have Middle Eastern heritage. Almost tri-lingual. I go back and forth with knowing and not knowing Spanish. Ironically, I have very low tolerance for spicy food, and up until recently my computer literacy was basic. No surprise I'm the black sheep among my fellow South East Asian comrades.</p>
